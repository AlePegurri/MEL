############################### WINDOWS ######################################
open windows powershell

verify that python is working: type
python

python should open in the same window, and you should see this at the beginning of the line:
>>>
if you do, then return to the powershell with 
exit()

otherwise, it means that python is not set as environment variable. To do this, type
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;PYTHONPATH")
and replace PYTHONPATH with your actual python path.
Then try again to open python.

In order for MEL to be recognized as command, you need also to have the folder
PYTHONPATH/Scripts among environment variables. If you don't, then type
[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "$env:Path;PYTHONPATH/Scripts")

Before installing MEL, make sure to have all the required python libraries.
If it's the first time you install python, you can add all the required libraries using pip install command:

pip install numpy
pip install scipy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib

you can run these commands from any path.

Now go to the MEL folder, where you find the file setup.py, and type
python setup.py install

the folders build,dist should be updated and MEL.egg-info should be generated.
At this point, MEL is a command you can run.

You can now try to run one of the examples.
Copy the folder "inp" and the file "input_lumping.txt" in a new folder in any path.
Remember to change the path to the OS folder appropriately.
Inside the folder, to run MEL just type

MEL input_lumping.txt

if you do not want the verbose output, run instead

MEL input_lumping.txt > stdoud.log

The log file contains a description of the operations currently run by the code
so that the user knows what the code is doing.

NB: also anaconda installation works on linux (see below). Make sure you
are using Anaconda Powershell Prompt so you are able to activate the environment
and also execute other commands from the powershell.

############################## LINUX USING CONDA #############################
If you don't have conda installed, install it:
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
chmod +x Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh
./Anaconda3-2020.11-Linux-x86_64.sh

copy the environment.yml file where you want to call conda for the env generation.
Create the appropriate environment for MEL using

conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate envMEL_auto (activates the environment)

Download MEL folder:
git clone git@github.com:lpratalimaffei/MEL.git
Enter MEL folder and run
python setup.py install

then try to run one of the examples with the command

MEL input_lumping.txt & (to get a verbose output, otherwise redirect to > stdout.log)
