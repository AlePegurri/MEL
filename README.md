# MEL
Master Equation based Lumping code for integrating single PESs into global kinetic schemes

Requirements:

- Windows operating system (only tested on Windows for now)
- OpenSMOKE++ (available at https://www.opensmokepp.polimi.it/menu-download)
- python version > 3.6

Installation: 

from MEL repository, run
python setup.py install

Testing:

All examples in the examples directory were already run. 
For each case, to run from scratch:
copy just the folder "inp" and the file input_lumping.txt

from the selected folder, run
MEL input_lumping.txt
