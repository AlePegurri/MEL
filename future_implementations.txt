1. high pressure limit rate constants
2. automatic fits of arrhenius duplicates when 1 arrhenius provides bad fitting
3. automatic selection of isomers to lump and list of names
4. automatic check on BFs of reactant composition and automatic detection of inconsistent isomers
5. completely remove reactions if they are irrelevant
6. processing of CKI mechanism with reversible reactions and chebyshev polynomials
7. Species with the same color in plots?

put in the input parameters which can be changed:
 - cutoff
 - tolerance to species composition (0.03 for BFs, and 0.05 for bimolecular species)
 - last step: put together the lumped mechanism automatically
