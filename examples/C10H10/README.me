Warning:

running all steps brings to a less accurate mechanism found in

lumpedmech/kin_initial.txt

To get more accurate results: 
run the case with inp/kin_reduced.CKI mechanism

in input_lumping.txt reduce the T range to [700 2000]

Then replace the following rates in lumpedmech/kin_initial.txt to obtain lumpedmech/kin.txt:

T1a_L => T4a_L
T1a_L => N7a_L+H
T4a_L => C5H5+C5H5
T4a_L => T1a_L
T4a_L => N1a_L+H
